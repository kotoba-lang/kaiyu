  "回遊 — how visitors move through a site, measured without identifying them.

  The rules a site needs in order to answer 『どの面が読まれ、次にどこへ行くか』
  from counters alone: a closed route vocabulary, coarse dwell buckets, an
  acquisition bucket derived from (never containing) the referrer, first-order
  transition edges, and the window arithmetic a report is read through.

  Everything here is pure and portable. Storage and transport are the host's:
  a Worker writes D1 rows, a Pages Function writes its own, a browser sends a
  beacon. What must NOT be the host's is the vocabulary — two sites that pick
  their own bucket boundaries produce numbers that look comparable and are not.

  ## The invariant this library exists to hold

  **No visitor identifier, ever.** Not a session id, not a cookie of its own,
  not a fingerprint, not a duration in seconds, not a path, not a query value.
  Only counts, dates, and names drawn from closed sets that live in this file.
  shinshi.club's `legal/privacy.md` §1.2 states publicly that the service holds
  『counts and dates only — no IP address, no device fingerprint, and no user
  identifier』; a library that made it easy to widen that would make the
  statement false. So the API takes vocabularies as arguments and refuses
  anything outside them, rather than offering a `sanitize` that lets values
  through in a modified form.

  What that costs, stated once so nobody rediscovers it as a surprise: paths of
  three or more hops, per-user funnels, causal attribution of an exit, and
  cohort-by-behaviour comparisons are all unavailable. They are not missing
  features. Buying them means changing what is stored about people, which is a
  privacy decision and not a library decision.

  ## Origin

  Extracted 2026-08-07 from two independent implementations that had converged
  on the same shape a day earlier (ADR-2608060900): `club-shinshi-app`'s
  `shinshi.worker.telemetry` (Worker + D1) and `net-babiniku`'s
  `babiniku.analytics` + `functions/api/track.js` (browser + Pages Function).
  Both had already duplicated the bucket boundaries, the whitelist-not-sanitize
  rule and the window arithmetic; the third consumer is what makes the
  duplication worth removing rather than worth watching."

(def dwell-buckets
  "Coarse buckets of ACTIVE seconds, in order. Ordered because a report renders
  them as a distribution and an alphabetical sort puts `10_29` before `lt10`.

  Coarse on purpose: on a low-traffic site an exact per-visit duration starts
  to behave like an identifier, so the duration is never stored — only which
  bucket it fell in. The boundaries are the ones shinshi.club and babiniku.net
  both shipped; changing them is not a code change, it is a decision to make
  historical rows incomparable with new ones."

  Drift is tolerable in exactly one direction. A route the app added but the
  vocabulary does not name reports as `other` — coarser, still correct. The
