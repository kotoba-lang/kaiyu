  "What a 回遊 report SAYS is wrong — the judgment half, kept pure and separate
  from both the measuring and the acting.

  `kaiyu.core` decides what may be recorded. This decides what the recording
  means, and it is deliberately the only place that does: an orchestrator that
  both fetches and judges ends up with its rules spread through its I/O, where
  they cannot be tested and quietly become whatever the last incident made
  them.

  Every finding here is a QUESTION a human can answer, not a verdict. The data
  is counts and dates with no visitor identity (that is the whole design), so
  it can locate where attention stops and where it never arrives — it cannot
  say why. A finding that claimed to know why would be inventing the part the
  measurement deliberately does not collect.

  ## The one rule that matters

  **Absence of rows is never evidence.** `kaiyu.core/measurement-state`
  distinguishes `:not-measured` / `:partial` / `:measured`, and
  `measurement-findings` refuses to read an empty section as a fact about
  visitors. The failure this prevents is the expensive one: on 2026-08-07
  `/_metrics/audience` answered 200 with zeros for a day while the table held
  595 pageviews, because every read threw and was swallowed. A loop that judged
  that report would have filed 『誰も来ていない』 issues, and every one of them
  would have been about a broken read.

  **What turns absence back into evidence.** A `:partial` section is normally
  allowed to be empty, because collection may have started an hour ago. But
  when a sibling section began collecting on the SAME DAY OR LATER and holds
  rows, the instrument demonstrably was not silent during this section's whole
  span, and the emptiness becomes a fact about this section rather than about
  how young the collector is. Measured 2026-08-13 on kotobase.net, whose
  `transitions` had held 0 rows since 2026-08-07 while `visits` — switched on
  the same day, read in the same response — had counted 575: two of the four
  site rules had been drawing on an empty section for six days and nothing said
  so. The finding still only asks, because counts cannot separate 「誰も回遊して
  いない」 from 「辺が emit されていない」; it is `:high` rather than `:blocked`
  for the same reason.

  **What absence can also mean.** A site may never have instrumented a section
  at all, and until 2026-08-14 that returned the same value as a beacon that
  broke — the failure this library exists to prevent, aimed at itself. Such
  sections are DECLARED with `:uninstrumented`; the declaration is reported in
  `:coverage`, and a declaration its own data contradicts is `:blocked` above
  whatever it was silencing. See `measurement-findings`.

  **Where collection STOPPED.** `measurement-state` is built entirely from
  `collected-since`, so it answers where a span began and has nothing to say
  about where it ended: a beacon that wrote for two days and died reports the
  same `:partial` as one still writing, and every site rule then draws on
  frozen rows under the window's name. Measured 2026-08-15 on babiniku.net,
  whose three sections had been byte-identical since 08-11 while the tick
  reported `ok` and the queue was asked the same dead-end question on 08-11,
  08-12 and 08-13. A caller that can re-query supplies `:recent` (see
  `kaiyu.core/recent`), and `staleness-findings` asks about it. Deliberately
  never `:blocked`: a quiet site has exactly this shape, and blocking it would
  hand a low-traffic site the permanent silence `:uninstrumented` was added to
  undo, twice.

  **What this does NOT do**, written down because the opposite claim stood here
  until 2026-08-11 and was false: the four site rules receive `:rows` and never
  see `:state`. They fire on a `:partial` section, and on a `:not-measured` one
  whose `:blocked` finding was suppressed because the site went live inside the
  window. The numbers they produce are real, but they describe a shorter period
  than the window names — measured that day on babiniku.net, whose first-ever
  candidate was a dead-end drawn from a single day of edges and labelled with a
  seven-day window.

  So every finding carries the `:sections` it drew on, `diagnose` returns
  `:coverage`, and `->issue` prints the span the evidence is true within.
  Whether a rule should fire on `:partial` at all is deliberately NOT settled
  here: gating on `:measured` would silence three of four live sites until each
  accumulates a full window, and choosing silence over a caveated number is a
  product decision, not a library one."

  "Rules about the instrument, checked before any rule about the site.

  A section that is `:not-measured` inside a window the site was live for is
  either a beacon that stopped or a read that throws — both are urgent, and
  neither is a fact about visitors.

  **There is a third reading, and until 2026-08-14 this returned the same value
  for it.** A site can simply not instrument a section at all. kotobase.net is
  a build-time-generated multi-page site with no client script: its store
  returns `(kaiyu/section win [] nil)` as a literal constant and says so in its
  own docstring (『Dwell is not measured here』). The three answers the question
  offers — beacon stopped / read threw / nobody came — are all wrong for it, and
  no human can close the issue, because there is nothing to fix and nothing to
  wait for. Left alone it is worse than noise: `diagnose` short-circuits on
  `:blocked`, so one permanently-unanswerable finding silences every site rule
  for that site forever. Measured on kotobase.net: its window first rolled past
  `:site-live-since` for the window ending 2026-08-13, and from that window on
  its four site rules stopped being evaluated — including the acquisition
  finding that had been top in all five recorded rounds before it.

  So a site may DECLARE the sections it does not collect, via `:uninstrumented`.
  Two things keep that from becoming a mute switch:

  - the declaration is carried in `coverage`, so a reader sees 「宣言により
    計測していない」 rather than a section that quietly is not mentioned;
  - a declaration contradicted by its own data is itself `:blocked`, and ranks
    above what it was silencing. A site that starts collecting the section, or
    a declaration copied onto the wrong site, surfaces on the next tick instead
    of muting it.

  What it is NOT for: a section that is instrumented and returning nothing.
  shinshi.club's `transitions` read null on the same day, while its `dwell` —
  client-observed, same beacon, same response — held ten rows. That is the case
  this rule exists to catch, and declaring it away would delete the finding."
